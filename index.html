          Grammy nominated artist Lil Uzi Vert flaunts a vision and fashion sense just as loud as his “futuristic trap”
          sound and dynamic voice. The Philadelphia native first began to set the internet on fire with his explosive
          appearance on Carnage’s single “WDYW” alongside A$AP Ferg and Rich The Kid and later his turn on “Big Racks”
          for Young Thug’s Slime Season 2.
        </p>
        <p class="singer-about__text">Lil Uzi Vert later went on to rock the world with his highly acclaimed debut
          album, LUV IS RAGE 2, which quickly struck #1 on the Billboard 200 and became RIAA certified gold in less than
          two months following its release—now 2x platinum. One of the album’s hit singles “XO Tour Llif3” also went on
          to earn 7x platinum certification in addition to being recognized as the “Song of the Summer” at the 2017
          Video Music Awards. Pitchfork proclaimed the project to be “the Philadelphia native’s most musically developed
          work” while THE FADER declared that the rapper has “cemented himself as this oft-maligned generation’s true
          pioneer.”</p>
        <p class="singer-about__text">  In addition to Lil Uzi Vert’s 2018 Grammy nominations as “Best New Artist” and “Best Rap
          Performance”, he’s also received the “Breakout Artist of the Year Award” and the “Breakthrough Artist” award
          during Billboard’s 2017 Touring Awards. The rap superstar has also been featured on a number of
          record-breaking tracks including Migos’ RIAA 4X platinum certified and Grammy nominated “Bad and Boujee” along
          with DJ Esco’s platinum-certified “Too Much Sauce” with Future, to name a few. Lil Uzi Vert has notably graced
          the cover of Billboard’s 2017 “The Year In Music” issue, XXL’s 20th Anniversary Issue and THE FADER’s “Sex
          Issue.”</p>
        
        <p class="singer-about__text">
          2018 marked a new era for the superstar, with a number of honorable nominations, including “Favorite Album” at
          the 2018 American Music Awards, “Issa Wave” at the BET Social Awards, “Best New Hip-Hop Artist” and “Hip-Hop
          Song of The Year” at the 2018 iHeart Radio Music Awards. In addition, the talented artist was nominated in 3
          categories at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards: “Top Rap Artist,” “Top Rap Performance” and “Top Streaming
          Song.” Lil Uzi Vert has obtained a number of certifications for his ground-breaking tracks and features,
          including gold-certified “Neon Guts (Feat. Pharrell Williams),” platinum-certified “Sauce It Up,” and guest
          verses on Playboi Carti’s “Shoota” (platinum), Lil Baby’s “Life Goes On” (gold) and Travis Scott’s “Watch”
          (platinum).
        </p>
        <p class="singer-about__text">His earlier singles are also certified-hits: “Money Longer”(2x platinum), “You Was Right” (2x
          platinum), “Dark Queen” (platinum), “Do What I Want” (platinum), “Ps & Qs” (platinum), “The Way Life Goes”
          (platinum); in addition to his breakthrough project, LIL UZI VERT VS. THE WORLD (platinum).</p>
